Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Tableau and Power BI to create insightful and interactive data visualizations from various datasets. The goal is to enable data-driven decision-making by transforming complex data into readable, engaging dashboards.

# Tableau Section
# Description
Created interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize and analyze datasets such as sales trends, employee metrics, cryptocurrency timelines, and global incidents.

Dashboards provide insights through visual representations like maps, charts, and time series analyses.

Each dashboard is designed to highlight key trends, patterns, and actionable insights.

# Sample Dashboards
Transaction Dashboard: Visualizes bakery sales data, including top items sold, transaction frequencies by time, and weekly transaction totals.

Cryptocurrency Timeline: Shows historical prices, market cap, and volume for various cryptocurrencies highlighting trends before and after price crashes.

Global Terrorism Visualization: Interactive map showing deaths and injuries from terrorist attacks worldwide.

# How to Use
Clone the repository.

Open Tableau workbooks (.twb or .twbx files) in Tableau Desktop.

Explore dashboards and interact with filters and parameters.

SQL queries used for data preparation are included where applicable.

# Power BI Section
# Description
Utilized Power BI to transform raw datasets into meaningful visualizations and interactive dashboards.

Leveraged Power Query for data cleaning and shaping.

Used data modeling features to create relationships between tables and DAX for calculated measures.

Visuals include cards, tables, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and maps to represent data from multiple perspectives.

# Features
Data cleaning and transformation.

Dynamic data modeling.

Advanced calculations using DAX.

Interactive dashboards with slicers and drill-through capabilities.

# How to Use
Clone the repository.

Open Power BI reports (.pbix files) in Power BI Desktop.

Explore visualizations and interact with dashboard elements.

# Project Insights and Learnings
Developed skills in data cleaning, modeling, and visualization techniques.

Created user-friendly dashboards that facilitate exploration of complex datasets.

Applied real-world datasets to uncover trends and support decision-making.

Demonstrated proficiency in both Tableau and Power BI tools.

# Additional Notes
The repository may include exported images or PDFs of dashboards for quick preview.

Links to Tableau Public dashboards or Power BI online reports can be provided for interactive access.

Contributions and feedback are welcome to enhance the visualizations and analyses.
